# Neovim Setup

This is my Neovim setup. It uses few essential plugins. Also, I use Lazy as a plugin manager.

## Requirements

You need to install couple of things to before cloning the repo.

**Install Homebrew**

Fork the repo if you want to.

Move to `.config` directory and clone this repo and you are done.

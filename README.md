# Neovim Setup

This is my Neovim setup. It uses few essential plugins. Also, I use Lazy as a plugin manager.

## Requirements

You need to install couple of things to before cloning the repo.

**Install Homebrew**
Visit [https://brew.sh/](here)

**Install iterm2**
Visit [https://iterm2.com/](here)

**Install Nerd Font**

```
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
```

**Install Neovim**

```
brew install neovim
```

**Install Ripgrep**

Fork the repo if you want to.

Move to `.config` directory and clone this repo and you are done.
